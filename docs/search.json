    "text": "∗ What do you think being a data scientist is about?\nBeing a data scientist is about extracting meaningful insights from data to solve problems and support decision-making. This involves collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data, building predictive models, and effectively communicating findings to stakeholders. It requires a blend of statistical knowledge, programming skills, and domain expertise.\n∗ What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nData scientists and statisticians both analyze data to extract insights and inform decision-making. However, data scientists often work with larger and more varied datasets, use advanced programming and machine learning techniques, and handle the entire data pipeline. Statisticians focus more on the theoretical aspects of statistics and hypothesis testing, using traditional statistical methods and software.\n∗ How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nI think I am more of a statistician than a data scientist.\n\n\nWhen you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
